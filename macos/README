Dependencies
------------

Blink Qt mainly depends on python3-sipsimple. Follow the instructions to install it from: 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AGProjects/python3-sipsimple/master/install_osx_user.sh

Run python3-sipsimple install script:

./install_sipsimple.sh

Once python3-sipsimple is installed:

pip3 install --user -r macos/requirements-osx.txt
sudo port install libvncserver upx create-dmg
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib"
./build_inplace

Running Blink in place:

./run


Making an app
-------------

Generate a spec file used by pyinstaller using make_spec.sh script. The
resulting file must be tweaked, see the modified blink.specs file.

Copy blink.spec in the main source directory, edit it and set
codesign_identity to your Developer id.

pyinstaller blink.spec -y

The generated app can then be found in dist/ folder.

To generate a .dmg run:

./macos/create_dmg.sh 

Note. The resulting DMG has a very large size due to bundling of all system
installed Qt6 frameworks and Python packages.  This can be optimized by
removing unused libraries during building the app stage.


Local storage
-------------

Blink Qt configuration and stored data folder on Mac:

~/Library/Application\ Support/Blink-Qt/
