Install pyinstaller from https://pyinstaller.org

and optional upx utility to compact the image.

Generate a spec file used by pyinstaller using make_spec.sh script. The
resulting file must be tweaked, see the modified blink.specs file.

Copy blink.spec in the top directory and edit at least the code signing
identity, then go there and run:

pyinstaller blink.spec

The generated MacOS app can then be found in dist/ folder.
