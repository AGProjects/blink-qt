Dependencies
------------

Blink Qt mainly depends on python3-sipsimple. 

Follow the instructions to install it from: 

https://github.com/AGProjects/python3-sipsimple/blob/master/install_osx_user.sh

Once python3-sipsimple is installed:

pip3 install --user -r macos/requirements-osx.txt
sudo port install libvncserver upx
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib"
./build_inplace

Running Blink in place:

./run


Making an app
-------------

Generate a spec file used by pyinstaller using make_spec.sh script. The
resulting file must be tweaked, see the modified blink.specs file.

Copy blink.spec in the top directory and edit at least the code signing
identity, then go there and run:

pyinstaller blink.spec

The generated MacOS app can then be found in dist/ folder.


Local storage
-------------

Blink Qt configuration and stored data folder on Mac:

~/Library/Application\ Support/Blink-Qt/
