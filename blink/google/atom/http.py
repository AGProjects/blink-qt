"""HttpClients in this module use httplib to make HTTP requests.

This module make HTTP requests based on httplib, but there are environments
in which an httplib based approach will not work (if running in Google App
Engine for example). In those cases, higher level classes (like AtomService
and GDataService) can swap out the HttpClient to transparently use a 
different mechanism for making HTTP requests.

  HttpClient: Contains a request method which performs an HTTP call to the 
      server.
      
  ProxiedHttpClient: Contains a request method which connects to a proxy using
      settings stored in operating system environment variables then 
      performs an HTTP call to the endpoint server.
