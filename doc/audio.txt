Audio device sharing on Linux
-----------------------------

Some audio devices support hardware mixing. Such devices can be opened
multiple times from different application natively. If this is not the
case, you will notice that is not possible to play music or process audio 
in other applications while running Blink.

For audio devices that can be opened only once at a time, there are
workarounds. More information about them can be found at:
