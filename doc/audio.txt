Audio device sharing on Linux
-----------------------------

Some audio cards support hardware mixing. Such cards can be opened at the
same time from different applications natively. If this is not the case,
you will notice that is not possible to play music or process audio in
other applications while running Blink.

For audio cards that can be opened only once at a time, there are
workarounds. More information about them can be found at:
