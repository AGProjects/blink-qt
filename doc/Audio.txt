Audio device sharing on Linux
-----------------------------

Some audio devices support hardware mixing, these device can be opened
multiple times from different application natively. If this is not the case,
you will notice that is not possible to use SIP SIMPLE client SDK and play
music or use other audio applications at the same time with the default
system configuration.

For audio devices that can be opened only once, there are workarounds. More
information about them can be found at:
