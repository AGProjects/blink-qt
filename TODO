Bonjour messaging
-----------------

- Only use one contact for Bonjour, prefferably TLS, then TCP and finally UDP
- Update Bonjour network ip:port in Chat window if remote client changes them
- Remove unused options from Bonjour messages preferences panel


Old entries
-----------

- Device switching window when detected at runtime
- Dial SIP URIs from the system
- Desktop notifications
- History browser
- External Alert URL handler
- Answering machine
- Have the icon selection on the account state button's menu
- Explore the scaledContents attribute for the IconSelector label
- fix dialed uri (% encode them to avoid errors)
- handle http:// urls using QDesktopServices from QtGui
- remove objects from the ID mapping when deleted, as they can't be resurrected
- add "Remove from group" context menu entry
- review presence code, _NH_CFGObjectSettingsDidChange logic on publisher.
  should we publish if xcap is disabled?
- store url, etag & hash in IconDescriptor
- re-evaluate what to do about missing icons. maybe have a blink://no-icon
  url when the icon is deleted
- save state timestamp so we don't overwrite the state when we start a new
  instance of blink and it publishes its old state on startup
- when accepting a new contact from a presence request it adds the URI but
  it is not set as type SIP (it has no type selected)
