Roadmap

Fixes and improvements
----------------------

- Have the icon selection on the account state button's menu
- Explore the scaledContents attribute for the IconSelector label
- fix dialed uri (% encode them to avoid errors)
- handle http:// urls using QDesktopServices from QtGui
- remove old python 2.6.x code from sipsimple ?
- remove objects from the ID mapping when deleted, as they can't be resurrected
- add "Remove from group" context menu entry
- do we really need instance_id in bonjour? we could use user@domain
  also what we publish should be a runtime id, not settings.instance_id,
  unless the latter is made a RuntimeSetting
- show edit/delete/set address as default menu entries in bonjour/google
  detail views? 
- should we let email addresses from google contacts become default URIs?
  should we even include them as URIs?
- review presence code, _NH_CFGObjectSettingsDidChange logic on publisher.
  should we publish if xcap is disabled?
- store url, etag & hash in IconDescriptor
- re-evaluate what to do about missing icons. maybe have a blink://no-icon
  url when the icon is deleted
- save state timestamp so we don't overwrite the state when we start a new
  instance of blink and it publishes its old state on startup
